README

In order to test the bc calculator, the user must place their input into the Java/calculator/input.txt or provide a different text file to read from.

Supplied with the submission are suite of test case files, these tests must be named instead of input.txt to run:
	function_tests.txt
	for_loop_tests.txt
	while_loop_tests.txt
	if_statement_tests.txt
	library_func_tests.txt
	special_exp_tests.txt
	variable_tests.txt
	arithmetic_tests.txt
	boolean_tests.txt


Commands to run in order to test program:
	cd Java/calculator/
	antlr4 Calculator.g4 -visitor
	javac Calculator*.java Scope.java EvalVisitor.java Main.java
	cd ..
	java calculator.Main calculator/input.txt


Features implemented:
	Comments: /* ... */
	Basic expressions with variables
	Boolean Expressions
	Precedence
	Special Expression: read and sqrt
	Expressions
	Math library functions: s, c, l, e
	if-then-else statements
	while statements
	for loops
	user-defined functions


Key Notes:
	Any input that is not an if/else, while, for, or function definition requires a semi-colon ;
	All functions must have a return statement
	Recursive functions are kind of supported, they are not useful though, because we don't support conditional return statements. So they just recursively run forever.
